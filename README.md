# Bad Apple but it plays in multiple browser windows

Live deployment: [https://bad-apple.oirnoir.dev/](https://bad-apple.oirnoir.dev/)

Calibrating it lets it know the distance from the top of the browser window to the top of the screen. This lets it display things properly.

Once it's calibrated, open it in multiple windows in Firefox or Chrome and it will play Bad Apple, synchronized and lined up in your multiple browser windows.
